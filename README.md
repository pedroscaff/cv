## About me

I'm a backend focused software generalist with a broad range of skills. I can work with different technologies and learn fast. I have experience working with high quality standards and agile teams. I like setting up processes and helping teams work better and be more productive. I highly value a healthy and happy work environment.

My current job is as a software engineer at [Sanctuary Computer](https://www.sanctuary.computer/). My team works on the development of the OS and backend services for the [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) (LP). We work closely with the LP founders to develop new features and handle technical debt. I joined 5 months before the launch of the Light Phone III, the most ambitious project both Sanctuary Computer and Light have ever done. We managed to successfully launch the phone in Feb/2025 with great feedback from the specialized media and the LP community. Since joining I helped the team further develop software engineering best practices such as using proper QA tools and to constantly refactor code to simplify and speed up development.

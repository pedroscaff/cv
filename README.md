## About me

I'm a full stack engineer with a broad range of skills. I can work with different technologies and learn fast. I have experience working with high quality standards and agile teams. I like setting up processes and helping teams work better and be more productive. I highly value a healthy and happy work environment.

I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Vay](https://vay.io). I'm the main responsible for the user interface that is used to remotely drive a car. I work both on the web app and on the embedded C++ part of the software. I setup the CI/CD for the web application and API including deployment to the cloud.
